Windows Virtual Address Translation and the Pagefile.
=====================================================

A fundamental capability of any memory analysis framework is to reconstruct
the virtual address space from the memory image. While in principle this task
is documented by the Intel or AMD programmer manuals, in practice one needs to
take into account operating system specific information to fully use all the
information available.

Rekall is the first open source memory forensic framework to currently take
advantage of the pagefile during the analysis of windows systems. The WinPmem
acquisition tool since version 1.6.2 is capable of automatically capturing the
pagefile during acquisition.

In this blog post we explore how Rekall translates virtual addresses into
their physical offsets - a pre-requisite to being able to read process and
kernel address spaces.
______________________________________________________

I was recently at the SANS DFIR Summit and got to speak with many practitioners
using memory analysis tools such as Rekall or Volatility. One of the comments I
found interesting is that people asked why do we not use the pagefile for
windows investigations? Apparently many people have found that critical
information was not recoverable by Rekall or Volatility because the pages were
not resident (according to the tool).

I decided to add pagefile support to Rekall, and as a result of my research into
how paging works in Windows, I have discovered many interesting facts about the
way windows performs virtual address translation. This blog post discusses what
I found and how this analysis is implemented in Rekall. The below reflects my
current understanding of how things work, but since the exact behavior is not
documented by Microsoft, there may be inaccuracies. If you spot an error, please
let me know so we can take new information into account.

Acquiring the pagefile.
-----------------------

The first step to analyzing the pagefile is to actually acquire it. When the
operating system is running, the pagefile is locked for exclusive use of the
operating system. This means that it is generally not possible to open and read
the file directly (Future versions of WinPmem should have support for
automatically exposing the pagefile from kernel space.).

The traditional way to copy the pagefile out is via the TSK toolset, using for
example a command such as:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
C:\> fcat.exe pagefile.sys \\.\c: > pagefile.dd
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

This opens the raw device corresponding to the C drive, and extracts the file
pagefile.sys by parsing the NTFS filesystem directly - thereby bypassing the
Windows file locking.

I integrated a statically compiled version of `fls.exe` in Winpmem and updated
the tool to allow for the acquisition of the pagefile in addition to the
standard ELF format memory image.

The pagefile is appended to the ELF file (so it does not appear in any program
headers) and a short YAML footer is appended. This allows us to write the image
to a non seekable pipe (e.g. so it can be sent over netcat or encrypted) while
still appending data to it. When Rekall reads the image it follows the
`PreviousHeader` pointer in each YAML footer to traverse all the footers.

Rekall can automatically identify the pagefile embedded in this file and add it
to the analysis. It is possible to simply extract the pagefile from the Winpmem
image by using dd (for example in order to use it in another framework):

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
  $ dd if=swapped.elf of=pagefile.dd bs=1 skip=$((0x3ff8e1bd))
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Adding the pagefile to Rekall.
------------------------------

So now that Winpmem can acquire the pagefile we can add the pagefile into
Rekall. But the main problem is how?

Rekall uses a "Paging Address Space" (for example the `AMD64PagedMemory` address
space) to translate virtual addresses to physical addresses. The process is
illustrated in the figure below. The Virtual Address Space is stacked over the
physical address space (i.e. the image) such that a `read()` operation issued to
the Virtual Address Space is translated into a specific offset from the image.

.The virtual address space is stacked over the physical image.
image::posts/2014-10-25-pagefile/address_space.jpg[align="center"]

Unfortunately the existing code makes frequent use of the physical address. For
example, the scanning infrastructure optimizes physical address space read
operations, scanning plugins typically scan the physical address space for pool
signatures etc. It would be a major refractoring exercise to modify plugins to
also support the pagefile.

There has to be an easier way! The solution we came up with in Rekall is to map
the pagefile into the physical address space too. After all, the pagefile is
simply an extension of the physical memory; When physical memory is exhausted,
the operating system simply moves the page into the pagefile. Similarly we can
reference its new location in the same physical address space. This scheme is
illustrated in the figure below.

.The pagefile is mapped into the physical address space.

The previous Rekall implementation uses the `AMD64PagedMemory` address space for
all operating systems, but obviously we need to treat the windows page file
differently from other operating systems when we support windows specific
pagefiles. In fact there is a subtle bug in previous Rekall versions (and
Volatility), which use this code to determine if a PTE is valid:

[source,python]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
    def entry_present(self, entry):
        '''
        Returns whether or not the 'P' (Present) flag is on
        in the given entry
        '''
        if entry:
            if entry & 1:
                return True
            # The page is in transition and not a prototype.
            # Thus, we will treat it as present.
            if (entry & (1 << 11)) and not entry & (1 << 10):
                return True
        return False
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

This code is a holdover from the old Volatility code base and was introduced
back when people noticed that many pages on a windows image are in
`Transition`. Pages in the `Transition` state are waiting to be written to the
pagefile but still contain valid data. It's just that as far as the hardware is
concerned they are not valid (so CPU access to these pages will generate a
pagefault). Windows uses the special `Transition` and `Prototype` flags (bits 10
and 11) to indicate the page is in transition. Volatility can simply treat the
page as valid anyway (since it still contains valid data). This was a good idea
at the time and gave us access to more valid pages on windows images.

But this code is strictly incorrect! The `AMD64PagedMemory` address space is
used for all operating systems and other operating systems do not use bits 10
and 11 in this way. Hence it is likely that this would produce subtly corrupted
data on Linux and OSX!

Clearly we need to have a specialized address space for the different operating
systems. Hence in Rekall we introduce the `WindowsAMD64PagedMemory` which is
only active for windows profiles. This address space actually changes the way
that virtual page translation is done almost completely to emulate the Windows
kernel as accurately as possible. Linux and OSX should get their own address
spaces in future (e.g. to handle compressed memory).

Virtual Page Translation in windows.
------------------------------------

In this section we try to summarize how virtual page translation works on
Windows. The seminal work on this subject was actually published back in 2007 by
`Jesse Kornblum` (*Kornblum, Jesse D. "Using every part of the buffalo in
Windows memory analysis." Digital Investigation 4.1 (2007): 24-29*). This was a
short but extremely important paper on the subject. (I am frankly a little
embarrassed that we did not implement the published algorithms until 2014 -
almost 7 years late!). Unfortunately things have changed or there are some
inaccuracies in the original work. We therefore need to re-examine paging on
windows currently and verify the algorithms published.

In the below I will try to summarize the important points and point out how
these are implemented in Rekall. In order to understand how paging works on
windows, I wrote a sample test program, which set up some known memory regions
marked with a known pattern (The source code can be seen below). I then acquired
the memory images (including pagefile) and attempted to reproduce the known
state of the program.

When the CPU addresses memory while running in protected mode, the Memory
Management Unit (MMU) is the hardware component which is responsible for
fetching the content from the physical memory. The MMU uses the Control Register
3 (`CR3`) to refer to `Page Tables` which specify a translation between the
virtual address and physical memory.

Since this translation happens in hardware it is very fast, and more importantly
it is operating system independent. The operating system simply sets up the page
tables in advance and then loads their address into the `CR3` register and the
hardware immediately translates the virtual memory according to this (This is
how process context switching works, the OS simply switches `CR3` from one
process's memory layout to the other and each process has a different virtual
memory layout).

The page tables are multi-level (e.g. on 64 bit architectures they have 4
levels) but essentially contain Page Table Entries (`PTE`). I wont go into the
specific of how the hardware follows the page tables themselves because that is
covered in many references, including
http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/processors/architectures-software-developer-manuals.html[Intel®
64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer Manuals]. My discussion below
focuses on 64 bit architectures, but 32 bit architectures are analogous.

The `PTE` is a 64 bit integer which is split into various bitfields and
flags. The PTE can be in a number of states, marked by various flags. These
states determine how to interpret the PTE. On Windows, there are kernel structs
which can be used in each state, making it easier to interpret the PTE. Below we
illustrate the states using the relevant kernel structs and Rekall.

There are two types of PTEs, which I will call `Hardware PTE` s and `Software
PTE` s. The Hardware PTEs are ones that can be seen in response to a page fault -
i.e. the hardware sees the PTE, as it traverses the page tables from the Page
Directory Entry (`PDE`). Hardware PTEs are typically allocated in low physical
memory addresses and form part of the page tables of the operating system.

Software PTEs are allocated out of pool space. Typically these PTEs are used to
manage large memory mappings. For example, when a VAD region is added, the
system allocates an array of continuous PTEs which will be used to control the
mapping. Software PTEs are usually the target of Prototype PTEs.

Although similar, `Software PTE` and `Hardware PTE` do not share exactly the
same states. Therefore I will list all the states that each type of PTE can have
under different headers.

Hardware PTE states
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Recall that a `Hardware PTE` is linked directly from the Page Directory Entry
(PDE). The following are the valid PTE states for it.

Valid State
^^^^^^^^^^^

The Valid state is signified by the Valid flag being set. In this case the
hardware is responsible for interpreting the PTE according to the layout of
`_PTE_HARDWARE`. Note that since the hardware must interpret the PTE - all
operating systems must use the exact same layout.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

If the Valid flag is not set, the hardware does not care about any of the other
flags, it will simply generate a pagefault into the operating system's pagefault
handler and pass the PTE to it. This means that for all the other states of the
PTE, the OS is free to interpret the PTE as it wishes, i.e. we must have
operating system specific code to handle invalid PTEs.

Transition State
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Windows has a `Working Set Trimmer` - a component which removes pages from
processes' working set (The Working Set is better known as the Resident Set in
POSIX, but is essentially the set of all pages that can be accessed by the
process without faulting.). The trimmer tries to remove pages into the pagefile
to increase the total number of available physical pages in the system. However,
rather than immediately writing the pages to the pagefile, the page is first put
into the transition state. This allows the page to be written into the pagefile
later, while still containing valid data in memory, in case the process needs
that page later (it can quickly be faulted back into the working set).

So a page in transition contains valid data, but when a process accesses it, the
hardware will pagefault into the OS handler which will simply mark the page as
valid.

Pages are in the Transition state if the Transition flag is on, and the
Prototype flag is off:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rekall can make immediate use of pages in Transition since their data is still
valid.

Prototype State
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The same physical pages may be shared between many different processes. This is
easy to do since you can just have multiple PTEs referring to the same physical
page. The problem for the OS is how to co-ordinate trimming of shared
pages. Since there are many references to the same physical page, if the OS
needs to e.g. relocate the physical page into the pagefile, it will need to
search and update all these references. Since this is very inefficient, the
Windows solution is to use a kind of "symlink" PTE to direct shared pages to
another PTE - called a `Prototype PTE`. Thus we only need to update the
Prototype PTE and all PTEs that refer to the shared memory will become
automatically updated.

So the best way to think of a Prototype PTE is that it is a `symlink` to
something else. Here is the windows struct for the Prototype PTE:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

      = 0 ->  0x0 Valid                           [BitField(0-1):Valid]: 0X000000
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The `ProtoAddress` field contains the address to the prototype PTE (which is
allocated from system pool). The target of the Prototype PTE is what I refer to
as a `Software PTE`, and can only take on the states appropriate for the
Software PTE (see below).

[NOTE]
================================================================================
The prototype PTE is allocated by the system, hence it is a Virtual Address in
the kernel's virtual address space. Contrast this with the `PageFrameNumber`
field from other states which refer to the physical address space.
================================================================================

VAD Prototype PTE
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If the `Hardware PTE` looks like a Prototype PTE (i.e. has Valid=0,
Prototype=1), and the `ProtoAddress` is equal to the special value
`0xFFFFFFFF0000` this marks a VAD Prototype. In this case we must find the VAD
region which corresponds with the virtual address in question. The `MMVAD`
struct then contains a range of PTEs which corresponds with the entire VAD
range. We then calculate the relative offset of the original virtual address
into the VAD region to find its corresponding PTE.

For example say we try to resolve address 0x10000:

1. Traversing the page tables we identify a VAD Prototype PTE
   (i.e. `ProtoAddress` = 0xFFFFFFFF0000).

2. We search the process VADs for the region of interest. Say we find a region
   from 0x8000 to 0x20000.

3. The _MMVAD object for this region has a `FirstPrototypePte` member (say it
   points to 0xFFFF1000000).

4. The PTE we want is therefore located at (0x10000 - 0x8000) / 0x1000 + 0xFFFF1000000

5. We resolve the physical address from that PTE.


Vad Hardware PTE
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If the PTE is completely 0, this means that the VAD should be consulted. This
condition seems to also be the case for when the PDE pointing to the PTE is
invalid (I.e. the entire page table is not valid). In this case we need to
examine the VAD in an identical way to the `VAD Prototype PTE` above.

This state seems to be identical to the one above.

Software State
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If both the `Prototype` and `Transition` flags are unset, the PTE refers to a
Software PTE:

The Software PTE refers to a paged out page. The `PageFileHigh` member is the
frame number in the page file (i.e. it must be multiplies by 0x1000 to get the
file offset). The `PageFileLow` member is the number of pagefile (Windows
supports up to 16 pagefiles).

Windows actually keeps data structures of the available pagefiles, their
location and stats. I wrote the `pagefiles` plugin to show this information:

You can see the size of the pagefile, and also the allocation bitmap (which
pages in the pagefile are currently used.). Note that the `PageFileNumber`
associates the `PageFileLow` member of the `_MMPTE_SOFTWARE` struct with the
pagefile path.

If we have the pagefile available, we can resolve the PTE immediately and read
the data from the pagefile.


Software PTE states
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For some of the states above, when the Hardware PTE is resolved, it might result
in referring to a Software PTE (e.g. in Vad PTEs or Prototype PTEs). Decoding
the Software PTE requires the following states.

Valid
^^^^^
Same as Hardware PTEs. Can be resolved immediately.

Transition
^^^^^^^^^^
Same as Hardware PTEs. Can be resolved immediately.

Subsection Prototype PTE
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If the PTE has the Prototype bit set, and Valid bit unset (P=1, V=0) it is a
Subsection PTE.

A Subsection PTE refers to an instance of a `_SUBSECTION` object and is used to
denote a File Mapping:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Subsection PTEs are used to refer to memory mappings of a file on disk. When a
file is mapped into memory (e.g. an executable file or DLL), the file may be
shared by many processes. Under memory pressure, the Windows Kernel needs to
evict pages from memory, possibly into the pagefile. However, it does not really
make sense to copy mapped executable pages into the pagefile, since they
originally came from a file mapping (e.g. from disk anyway). So it makes more
sense to read the file again from disk if needed in future, rather than waste
precious pagefile space on mapped files.

Unfortunately, if we do not have access to the disk image any more, we can not
recover the data in the page any more. We can however, determine directly which
file the page came from by inspecting the `ControlArea` field of the
`_SUBSECTION` (So for example _SUBSECTION.ControlArea.FilePointer.FileName). We
can also determine the offset in that file by subtracting the prototype PTE from
`_SUBSECTION.SubsectionBase` and adding the `_SUBSECTION.StartingSector`:

Demand Zero PTE
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If the PTE's target has (Valid=0, Prototype=0, Transition=0) and it also has
`PageFileHigh`=0, then this page is a demand zero page. The page fault handler
will simply assign a zero page in response to the page fault. Often this page
will also have non-zero `Protection` bits which should reflect the VAD's
original protections.

PTE Resolution Algorithm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to resolve the PTE we follow a possibly two step algorithm. First
resolve the Hardware PTE to receive a Software PTE, then resolve the software
PTE if needed.


.Resolving a Hardware PTE
image::posts/2014-10-25-pagefile/pagefile_algorithm1.png[align=center]

1. If the Valid flag is set, the PTE is valid and can be resolved immediately.

2. If the Transition flag is set, but the Prototype flag is unset, the PTE is in
   the Transition state and can also be resolved immediately.

3. If the Prototype flag is set, but the `ProtoAddress` field is equal to
   0xFFFFFFFF0000, this is a Vad PTE and we must consult the VAD to recover the
   Software PTE.

4. Alternatively if the PTE has all the Transition, Prototype and Valid flags
   unset, but the PageFileHigh field is zero, this is also a VAD PTE and we must
   consult the VAD.

5. If the PTE has all the Transition, Prototype and Valid flags unset, but the
   PageFileHigh field is not zero, this is a Page File PTE and we can recover
   the page from the pagefile.

6. Finally if the Prototype bit is on, then this is a Prototype PTE and we can
   read the `Software PTE` from the `ProtoAddress` field.

When we obtain the Software PTE we can decode it using a similar but slightly
different algorithm. Note that Prototype states are not allowed for Software
PTEs (i.e. you cant have a symlink to a symlink essentially).

.Resolving a Software PTE
image::posts/2014-10-25-pagefile/pagefile_algorithm2.png[align=center]


1. If PTE has Valid flag it is a valid PTE and can be resolved immediately.

2. If PTE has Transition flag set but Prototype flag unset, it is a Transition
   PTE and can be resolved immediately.

3. If the Prototype flag is set, then this is a File Mapping PTE which points to
   a _SUBSECTION object.

4. If all Valid, Prototype and Transition flags are unset, and `PageFileHigh` is
   also zero, then this is a Demand Zero mapping. Return a Zero page.

5. If all Valid, Prototype and Transition flags are unset, but `PageFileHigh` is
   not zero, then this is a PageFile PTE and we can return the page from the
   page file.


Experiment
----------

In order to study the effects of the new page translation code, I wrote a small
program which allocates a large memory block (using `VirtualAlloc`), fills the
memory with a pattern and then just Sleeps. Additionally I mapped a file and
also mapped a large region which is never touched (Demand Zero region):

[source,c]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
#include "Windows.h"

void create_file_mapping() {
  HANDLE  h;
  TCHAR *filename = L"c:\\windows\\notepad.exe";
  h= CreateFile(filename, GENERIC_READ,FILE_SHARE_READ,
                NULL,OPEN_EXISTING,FILE_FLAG_SEQUENTIAL_SCAN,NULL);

  DWORD size = GetFileSize(h, NULL);
  HANDLE hFileMapping = CreateFileMapping(h, NULL,PAGE_READONLY, 0, 0, NULL);
  char *view = (char*) MapViewOfFileEx(hFileMapping, FILE_MAP_READ, 0,  0,0,NULL);
  printf("Mapped file into %p %s\n", view, view);
}

int _tmain(int argc, _TCHAR* argv[])
{
  int number_of_pages = 202400;
  char *pointer = (char *)VirtualAlloc(
      NULL, number_of_pages * 0x1000,
      MEM_COMMIT | MEM_RESERVE,
      PAGE_READWRITE);

  char *pointer2 = (char *)VirtualAlloc(
      NULL, 2400 * 0x1000,
      MEM_COMMIT | MEM_RESERVE,
      PAGE_READWRITE);

  __int64 i;
  int j;

  // Read uninitialized data from the allocated range.
  char tmp = *pointer2;

  create_file_mapping();

  if (!pointer) {
    LogLastError();
    goto exit;
  };
  printf("Allocated %d pages at %p (%d mb)\n", number_of_pages,

I ran the program (`swapper.exe`) on a small Windows 7 VM with only 1GB of ram
allocated. I also enabled a few more columns in `Task Manager` to observe memory
usage. We can see that the program allocated over 800mb (Commit Size) but only
347Mb is currently resident in memory.

.Running a program which allocated a lot of virtual memory.
image::posts/2014-10-25-pagefile/swapper1.jpg[align="center"]

I then ran WinPmem to acquire the physical memory and the pagefile
(`winpmem-1.6.2.exe -p -e swapper.elf`).

.Acquiring memory with WinPmem.
image::posts/2014-10-25-pagefile/swapper2.jpg[align="center"]

The additional system activity caused the working set of the `swapper.exe`
program to be trimmed down to 118Mb within a few seconds. This is actually a
problem because the imager starts writing the image from physical address 0. The
page tables are typically found at very low physical addresses. For example in
this image, the `CR3` value is 0x187000 (About 1.6Mb) into the physical image.

Since it takes a finite time to write the image to disk, and the additional
system activity causes processes to be aggressively trimmed, it is very likely
that the page tables that are written within a fraction of a second from the
start of acquisition would contains PTE references to pages which, although were
valid at the start of acquisition, a few seconds later would be paged to disk
and re-purposed. The overall effect actually causes Rekall to think that pages
contain valid data but in reality they do not (i.e. a data corruption
problem). More research is required on the most optimal order of image
acquisition ....

Analysis
--------

I loaded the file into Rekall as normal and inspected the VAD regions of the
`swapper.exe` process using the `vad` plugin:

I modified the plugin `vtop` to perform the full analysis mentioned in this
paper and describe each intermediate step. We can therefore use it to examine
some interesting addresses in the `swapper.exe` address space.

I started off examining some of the pages allocated by `swapper.exe` in the
large `VirtualAlloc` region. These pages are marked by their page number so they
should be easy to identify (First we change the process context to the
`swapper.exe` using the `cc` plugin):

We examine the 4th allocated page. The `vtop` plugin finds the relevant PTE and
tells us that it is a software PTE. We therefore know that the relevant offset
into the pagefile is found in the `PageFileHigh` field. Lets see if this
produces the correct data:

Yes! The page is marked with the integer 4.

For the next example we want to read the binary itself for `swapper.exe`. This
is a very common requirement when dumping malware from memory. We see from the

This is a Prototype PTE which points to a Subsection PTE, backed by a file. We
can tell the name of the file and the `_FILE_OBJECT` responsible for it, but
alas this page is not found in the pagefile nor in memory. We would have to
retrieve it from the file system.

For the next example we try to dump the first page of the mapped
`ntdll.dll`. This DLL is mapped into every process so it is an example of shared
memory. The VAD tells us that it is mapped at 0x0000777b0000 for this process:

We see that the PTE is a Prototype PTE pointing to a valid page. We can dump it
out to see the familiar MZ header (Note that without interpreting the Prototype
PTE we would not be able to read this page at all - even though it is still

------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this special case, we see that the Prototype PTE has a `ProtoAddress` field
of 0XFFFFFFFF0000 - the magic signature for the VAD Prototype PTE. Rekall
therefore must search for the containing VAD region for the virtual address
0x000000110000. The output of the `vad` plugin is shown next, and the relevant
`_MMVAD` address is shown at 0xfa8001a44920. In this case we need to read the
first PTE, which is found to be valid. Hence we can read this page directly from
the memory image:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

I then used a hex-editor to confirm that this data is indeed the same as in the
`locale.nls` file.

Its actually kind of fun to look at the output of the `vad` plugin and call the
`vtop` plugin in random addresses to see how they are mapped. I thought it would
be useful to see how the entire region is mapped. I wrote the `vadmap` plugin
which outputs a map of all addresses in the vad of a process and how they are
mapped. Note that vadmap resolves the Prototype PTEs transparently, so if there
is a Prototype PTE that points to a Valid PTE, vadmap will say it is Valid.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

We can see some interesting points:

1. The executable `swapper.exe` is mapped from 0x000000b10000, but some pages
   are marked as file mappings, some as demand paging (for the spaces between
   the PE sections), while some are valid (i.e. contain code loaded into
   memory). We can see that if we dump the VAD region we will only be able to
   recover some of the pages.

2. We also see that significant number of pages exist in the pagefile. Note that
   `vadmap` can identify pages in the pagefile, regardless if we actually have
   the page file. This can sometimes be useful in order to assess how important
   it is to acquire the page file as well.

3. The entire region mapped for `notepad.exe` contains subsection PTEs - none of
   the data was ever read hence no pages were read from the file.

4. The second allocated region (Using VirtualAlloc at address 0x0000321d0000)
   was only read once at offset 0, but the rest of the region was never
   touched. This causes the first page to be backed by memory, and subsequently
   end up in the page file. The rest of the region remains at Demand Zero state
   because we never touched it.

Conclusions
-----------

All of the examples shown yield invalid pages in previous versions of
Rekall. However now, after properly interpreting the various PTEs in a windows
specific way, Rekall is able to recover useful data in all these cases. It is
quite interesting how much data we have been missing in the past. Even without
using the pagefile, we still missed a lot of data because we did not properly
support Prototype PTEs, and VAD PTEs. These could often point at a software PTE
which might still contain data inside the memory image itself.

How important this data is depends really on how you use memory analysis - if
you just want to analyze malware in a controlled environment (e.g. as in
http://www.cuckoosandbox.org/[Cuckoobox]) it is probably possible to create
favorable conditions - e.g. add lots of memory so the OS does not swap.

In an incident response situation, however, one has much less control over the
environment. Often responders are faced with busy systems, with potentially
significant memory pressures, causing a lot of less frequently used data to be
paged to disk. In this case we need to make as much as we can from the data we
do have, or as Jesse Kornblum said "Use Every Part of the Buffalo".

We are currently working on further testing and implementing pagefile support
for other operating systems (e.g. Linux and OSX). Although this feature is
really new and not well tested yet, I wanted to write about it here so people
know what we are working on for the next release and have a chance to try it
out. Please feel free to test and contribute to Rekall, and file issues on
github if you find any bugs.
