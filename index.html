<p>The Rekall Framework is a completely open collection of tools, implemented in
Python under the GNU General Public License, for the extraction of digital
artifacts from volatile memory (RAM) samples.  The extraction techniques are
performed completely independent of the system being investigated but offer
visibilty into the runtime state of the system. The framework is intended to
introduce people to the techniques and complexities associated with extracting
digital artifacts from volatile memory samples and provide a platform for
further work into this exciting area of research.</p>

<p>The Rekall distribution is available from:
<a href="https://code.google.com/p/rekall/">https://code.google.com/p/rekall/</a>
Rekall should run on any platform that supports
Python (<a href="http://www.python.org">http://www.python.org</a>)</p>

<p>Rekall supports investigations of the following x86 bit memory images:</p>

<ul>
<li>Microsoft Windows XP Service Pack 2 and 3</li>
<li>Microsoft Windows 7 Service Pack 0 and 1</li>
<li>Microsoft Windows 8 and 8.1</li>
<li>Linux Kernels 2.6.24 to 3.10.</li>
<li>OSX 10.6-10.8.</li>
</ul><p>Rekall also provides a complete memory sample acquisition capability for all
major operating systems (see the tools directory).</p>

<a name="quick-start" class="anchor" href="#quick-start"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Quick start</h2>

<p>Rekall is available as a python package installable via the pip package
manager. Simply type (for example on Linux):</p>

<pre><code>sudo pip install rekall
</code></pre>

<p>You might need to specifically allow pre-release software to be included (until
Rekall makes a major stable release):</p>

<pre><code>sudo pip install --pre rekall
</code></pre>

<p>To have all the dependencies installed. You still need to have python and pip
installed first.</p>

<p>To be able to run the ipython notebook, the following are also required:</p>

<p>pip install Jinja2 MarkupSafe Pygments astroid pyzmq tornado wsgiref</p>

<p>If you want to use the yarascan plugin, install yara and yara-python
(<a href="http://plusvic.github.io/yara/">http://plusvic.github.io/yara/</a>).</p>

<p>For windows, Rekall is also available as a self contained installer
package. Please check the download page for the most appropriate installer to
use (<a href="http://downloads.rekall.googlecode.com/git/index.html">http://downloads.rekall.googlecode.com/git/index.html</a>)</p>

<a name="history" class="anchor" href="#history"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>History</h2>

<p>In December 2011, a new branch within the Volatility project was created to
explore how to make the code base more modular, improve performance, and
increase usability. The modularity allowed Volatility to be used in GRR, making
memory analysis a core part of a strategy to enable remote live forensics.  As a
result, both GRR and Volatility would be able to use each others’ strengths.</p>

<p>Over time this branch has become known as the "scudette" branch or the
"Technology Preview" branch.  It was always a goal to try to get these changes
into the main Volatility code base.  But, after two years of ongoing
development, the "Technology Preview" was never accepted into the Volatility
trunk version.</p>

<p>Since it seemed unlikely these changes would be incorporated in the future, it
made sense to develop the Technology Preview branch as a separate project. On
December 13, 2013, the former branch was forked to create a new stand-alone
project named "Rekall.” This new project incorporates changes made to streamline
the codebase so that Rekall can be used as a library. Methods for memory
acquisition and other outside contributions have also been included that were
not in the Volatility codebase.</p>

<p>Rekall strives to advance the state of the art in memory analysis, implementing
the best algorithms currently available and a complete memory acquisition and
analysis solution for at least Windows, OSX and Linux.</p>
