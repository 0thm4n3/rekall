Rekall Technology Preview References
====================================

This document outlines futher information specifically focused on Rekall. As the
new framework matures and eabled further development, more information is
becoming available online.

[NOTE]
=====================================================================

Rekall was born from an effort to update The Volatility Memory Analysis
Framework. It was hosted for a while under the Volatility Project's SVN
repository in the "Scudette Branch". Therefore many of the below references
still refer to the "Volatility Technology Preview" as the precursor to the
Rekall project. The information is still relevant though and will be updated in
due course.
