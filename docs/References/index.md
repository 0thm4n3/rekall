# The Rekall Memory Analysis Site.

To improve the state of memory analysis education and training we have developed
a sister project: "The Memory Analysis Course". This is an open source course,
based around the Rekall tool to teach how memory analysis techniques can be
applied in practice. You can visit this site at
