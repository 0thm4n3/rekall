  \ It uses multiple features at the\n    same time:\n\n    - Multiple coloring rules\
  \ per line (this was a doozy).\n    - Two columns with colors next to each other.\n\
  \    - Text with its own newlines isn't rewrapped.\n    - It still wraps if it overflows\
  \ the cell.\n    - Bovine readiness and international spirit.\n    "
